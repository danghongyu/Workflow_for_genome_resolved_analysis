## Reductive dehalogenase (RDase) analysis

The RDases from assembled Dehalococcoides MAGs or clone library were self aligned with BLAST

The RDases from assembled Dehalococcoides MAGs and clone library were placed with RDases from public RDases database to build a phylogenetic tree with iqtree

Installation and usage of BLAST can be found: https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/doc/blast-help/downloadblastdata.html#downloadblastdata  

### The files for above analysis were provided in the folder: input_data
The files for RDase self-alignment: RDase_self_align.fasta

The files for building the phylogenetic tree: all_RDase_pro.fasta
