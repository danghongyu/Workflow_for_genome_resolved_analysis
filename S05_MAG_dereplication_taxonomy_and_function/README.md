Once the refining is completed. Bins with a completion >=80% and a contamination <=5% were designated as MAGs

The high quality MAGs from co-assembling and MAGs met above standard from individual assembling were dereplicated by using dRep.

By doing this we generated a comprehensive and non-redundant collection of MAGs from the microcosms.

The taxonomy of the MAGs is determined by GTDB-Tk.

The functional annotation of the MAGs is processed with Prokka and Anvi'o.
